# Phase 1 Analysis Summary

## Key Findings

### File Counts
- **Total files in prod**: 9,466
- **Total files in original**: 1,751
- **Files only in prod**: 8,061
- **Files only in original**: 346
- **Files with same name but different content**: 0
- **Files with same content but different paths**: 0

### Analysis Results

1. **No Content Conflicts**: There are no files with the same name but different content, and no files with identical content in different paths between the two directories.

2. **Massive Growth**: The `prod/` directory has grown significantly from the `original/` baseline, containing 5.4x more files.

3. **Clean Separation**: The two directories are essentially completely separate with no overlapping file content.

## Implications for Refactor

### Phase 2 Strategy
Since there are no content conflicts, Phase 2 can focus on:
- **File Selection**: Choose which version to keep (likely `prod/` as it's more current)
- **Structure Cleanup**: Organize the selected files into a clean, logical structure
- **Obsolete File Removal**: Identify and remove temporary, log, and development files

### Recommended Approach
1. **Use `prod/` as the base** since it contains the current production code
2. **Archive `original/`** as it represents an older, smaller codebase
3. **Focus on organizing `prod/`** into a clean structure rather than merging

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 2: File Deduplication and Cleanup
- Focus on organizing the 9,466 files in `prod/` into a clean structure
- Remove temporary files, logs, and development artifacts
- Create a new canonical directory structure

## Files to Review
The analysis shows many files that should be reviewed for cleanup:
- Log files (`.log`)
- Temporary files (`fixthatshit.txt`, `fixthisshit.txt`)
- Build artifacts
- Database dumps
- Development scripts
- Documentation that may be outdated
