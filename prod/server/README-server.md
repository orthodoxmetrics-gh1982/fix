# OrthodoxMetrics Server Directory Layout

**Last Updated:** July 31, 2025  
**Status:** Post-refactor - Production-ready structure

## 🏗️ Essential Runtime Directories

### Core Application Structure
```
server/
├── routes/           # API route handlers and endpoints
├── services/         # Business logic and external integrations  
├── controllers/      # Request/response controllers
├── models/          # Data models and schemas
├── config/          # Configuration files and settings
├── middleware/      # Express middleware functions
├── utils/           # Utility functions and helpers
└── index.js         # Main server entry point
```

### Runtime Data Directories
```
server/
├── data/            # Application runtime data
├── database/        # Database schemas and operations
├── logs/            # Application and error logs
├── uploads/         # File upload storage
└── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
```

## 📁 Directory Descriptions

### **routes/** (95+ files)
API endpoint definitions organized by feature:
- **admin/** - Administrative functionality
- **church/** - Church-specific operations  
- **kanban/** - Task management routes
- **omai/** - AI/ML integration routes
- **public/** - Public API endpoints
- **social/** - Social features and interactions

**Purpose:** Define HTTP endpoints, parameter validation, and route-level middleware

### **services/** (26+ files) 
Business logic and external service integrations:
- **omb/** - Orthodox Metrics Builder services
- Core application services for complex operations

**Purpose:** Encapsulate business logic, external API calls, and complex data processing

### **controllers/** (12+ files)
Request/response handling and orchestration:

**Purpose:** Coordinate between routes, services, and models; handle request validation and response formatting

### **models/** (5+ files)
Data model definitions and database interactions:

**Purpose:** Define data structures, database schemas, and data access patterns

### **config/** (12+ files)
Application configuration and setup:
- Database connections
- Session management  
- Environment-specific settings
- Third-party service configurations

**Purpose:** Centralize configuration management and environment setup

### **middleware/** (12+ files)
Express middleware for request processing:
- Authentication and authorization
- Request logging and monitoring
- Error handling
- Security controls

**Purpose:** Implement cross-cutting concerns and request/response processing

### **utils/** (54+ files)
Utility functions and helper modules:
- Database connections (`dbConnections.js`)
- Logging utilities
- Data formatting helpers
- Common functionality

**Purpose:** Provide reusable utility functions across the application

## 🗄️ Runtime Data Directories

### **data/** (12 references)
Application-specific runtime data:
- Build configurations
- Component manifests
- Church data
- JIT configurations

**Purpose:** Store application runtime data and configurations

### **database/** (1 reference)
Database-related files:
- SQL schema files
- Migration scripts
- Database utilities

**Purpose:** Manage database structure and operations

### **logs/** (6 references)
Application logging:
- Error logs
- Access logs
- Debug information

**Purpose:** Store application logs for monitoring and debugging

### **uploads/** (7 references)
File upload handling:
- Document storage
- Image uploads
- OCR file processing
- Temporary file storage

**Purpose:** Manage file uploads and document processing

### **types/** (0 direct references)
TypeScript type definitions:
- Interface definitions
- Type declarations
- Custom types

**Purpose:** Provide TypeScript type safety (referenced by compiler, not runtime)

## �� Additional Files

### **index.js**
Main server entry point:
- Express app configuration
- Route mounting
- Middleware setup
- Server startup logic

### **package.json** & **package-lock.json**
Node.js dependency management:
- Runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies
- Script definitions

### **ecosystem.config.cjs**
PM2 process management configuration

### **.env** files
Environment-specific configuration:
- Database credentials
- API keys
- Service URLs

## 🗂️ Archived Content

All non-runtime directories have been safely archived to `misc/server-archive/`:
- scripts/, cron/, setup/, backups/, temp/
- docs/, credentials/, legacy/, migrations/
- testing/, jobs/, certificates/, debug/
- scrapers/, templates/, ocr-results/

**Recovery:** `cp -r misc/server-archive/[directory] server/`

## 🚀 Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. **Routes:** Add to appropriate subdirectory in `routes/`
2. **Business Logic:** Create new service in `services/`
3. **Data Models:** Define in `models/`
4. **Utilities:** Add helpers to `utils/`

### File Organization
- Group related functionality in subdirectories
- Use descriptive filenames
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Document complex modules

### Configuration
- Environment-specific settings in `.env` files
- Shared configuration in `config/` directory
- Database settings in `config/db.js`

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Logs
- Monitor `logs/` directory for errors
- Rotate logs regularly to prevent disk space issues

### Uploads
- Clean `uploads/temp/` periodically
- Monitor disk usage in `uploads/` directory

### Dependencies
- Keep `package.json` updated
- Regular security audits with `npm audit`
