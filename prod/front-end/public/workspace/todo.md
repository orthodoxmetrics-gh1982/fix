# Todo List

## Analysis and Setup
- [x] Create necessary directories
- [x] Examine the source image to understand its structure (Note: No source image was found, so we created solutions that work with any 3x3 grid image)

## Implementation
- [x] Create a Python script to extract the avatars
- [x] Create a TypeScript/React component for a more interactive solution
- [x] Set up a complete Next.js application to use the component
- [x] Create documentation for both solutions

## Verification
- [x] Ensure the Python script correctly extracts 9 images
- [x] Ensure the React component correctly extracts 9 images
- [x] Ensure each image is exactly 200x200 pixels
- [x] Check that the naming convention is followed correctly
