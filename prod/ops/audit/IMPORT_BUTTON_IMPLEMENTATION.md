# Import Records Button - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary
The green "Import Records" button is now fully functional and connected to the backend. Users can import baptism, marriage, and funeral records from CSV, JSON, XML, and SQL files.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Components
- **`ImportRecordsButtonV2.tsx`**: Enhanced import button with multi-format support
  - Step-by-step wizard interface
  - File upload with drag-and-drop
  - Automatic field mapping with suggestions
  - Preview before import
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Support for CSV, JSON, XML, SQL formats

### 2. Backend API Endpoints
- **`/api/records/import/upload`**: Handles file upload and creates import job
- **`/api/records/import/preview`**: Returns preview and field mapping suggestions
- **`/api/records/import/commit`**: Starts the actual import process
- **`/api/records/import/status/:jobId`**: Returns import job status

### 3. Database Schema
- **`import_jobs`**: Tracks import jobs with status and progress
- **`import_files`**: Stores uploaded file information
- **`import_field_mappings`**: Stores field mapping configurations
- Enhanced record tables with:
  - `source_hash` for deduplication
  - `certificate_no` for tracking
  - Proper indexes for performance

### 4. Features
- ✅ Multi-format support (CSV, JSON, XML, SQL)
- ✅ Automatic field detection and mapping
- ✅ Preview before import
- ✅ Duplicate detection using source hash
- ✅ Progress tracking with real-time updates
- ✅ Error handling and validation
- ✅ Multi-tenancy support (church_id enforcement)
- ✅ Authentication required
- ✅ File size limit (50MB)
- ✅ Audit trail

## How to Use

### For End Users:
1. Navigate to the Records page
2. Select your church from the dropdown
3. Click the green "Import Records" button
4. Follow the 4-step wizard:
   - Upload your file
   - Map fields (automatic suggestions provided)
   - Preview your data
   - Start import and monitor progress

### Sample Files Available:
Located in `/server/data/sample-imports/`:
- `baptisms.csv` - Sample baptism records
- `baptisms.json` - JSON format example
- `marriages.csv` - Sample marriage records
- `funerals.csv` - Sample funeral records

## Technical Details

### File Processing Flow:
1. File uploaded to `/uploads/imports/` directory
2. SHA1 hash calculated for deduplication
3. Import job created in database
4. File parsed based on format
5. Fields mapped to canonical database columns
6. Records inserted/updated with duplicate detection
7. Progress updated in real-time

### Security:
- Authentication required (JWT or session)
- Church-level isolation (multi-tenancy)
- File type validation
- Size limits enforced
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries

## Testing the Import

### Quick Test:
```bash
# Use one of the sample files
/server/data/sample-imports/baptisms.csv

# Or create a simple test file:
echo "first_name,last_name,baptism_date,priest_name
John,Doe,2024-01-15,Fr. Smith
Jane,Smith,2024-02-20,Fr. Johnson" > test.csv
```

### Expected Results:
- File uploads successfully
- Preview shows correct field mapping
- Import completes with status updates
- Records appear in the table after refresh

## Troubleshooting

### If the button doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify user is logged in
3. Ensure a church is selected
4. Check PM2 logs: `pm2 logs orthodox-backend`

### Common Issues:
- **401 Unauthorized**: User not logged in
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid file format or missing data
- **500 Server Error**: Check backend logs

### Backend Logs:
```bash
# View real-time logs
pm2 logs orthodox-backend --lines 50

# Check for import-specific logs
pm2 logs orthodox-backend | grep -i import
```

## Next Steps
The import functionality is fully operational. Users can now:
1. Import historical records in bulk
2. Migrate data from other systems
3. Regularly update records via CSV uploads
4. Export and re-import for backup purposes
