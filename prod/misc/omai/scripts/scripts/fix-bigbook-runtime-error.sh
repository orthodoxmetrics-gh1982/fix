echo "==================================="

echo "1. Check browser console for new error details"
echo "2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)"

echo "If the Custom Components tab still has issues, you can:"
echo "1. Use the main Big Book upload area (first tab)"
echo "2. Upload ParishMap.tsx there"
