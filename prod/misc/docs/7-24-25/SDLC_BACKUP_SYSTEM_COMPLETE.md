# SDLC Backup System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The SDLC Backup System has been successfully implemented in OrthodoxMetrics to provide super administrators with comprehensive backup and restore capabilities for both production and development environments. This system is focused on file-based backups and is completely separate from any AI or calendar functionality.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend API Routes (`server/routes/admin/backups.js`)

- **GET `/api/backups/list?env=dev|prod`** - Returns list of available backups for the specified environment
- **POST `/api/backups/create`** - Creates a new backup of the specified environment
- **GET `/api/backups/download/:env/:filename`** - Downloads a specific backup file
- **POST `/api/backups/restore`** - Restores an environment from a backup
- **DELETE `/api/backups/:env/:filename`** - Deletes a specific backup file

### 2. Directory Structure

The system creates and manages the following directory structure:
```
/var/backups/orthodoxmetrics/
├── prod/          # Production environment backups
│   ├── 2025-01-23.zip
│   ├── 2025-01-24.zip
│   └── ...
└── dev/           # Development environment backups
    ├── 2025-01-23.zip
    ├── 2025-01-24.zip
    └── ...
```

### 3. Frontend Components

#### SDLCBackupPanel Component (`front-end/src/components/admin/SDLCBackupPanel.tsx`)
- Environment selection (prod/dev)
- Create backup functionality
- List of available backups with file details
- Download, restore, and delete operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Real-time status updates and loading states

#### Enhanced BackupSettings Component (`front-end/src/views/settings/BackupSettings.tsx`)
- **Tabbed Interface**: Two tabs - "Backup Settings" and "Your Backups"
- **Responsive Layout**: Main content (8 columns) + SDLC Backup panel (4 columns) for super admins
- **Integrated SDLC Backup Panel**: Positioned in the right column for super admin users

## How to Access

1. Navigate to: `https://orthodoxmetrics.com/admin/settings`
2. You'll see a tabbed interface with:
   - **Backup Settings tab**: Contains all the original backup configuration options
   - **Your Backups tab**: Shows the list of backup files
3. **SDLC Backup Panel**: Visible on the right side (super_admin users only)

## Features Available

### Environment Management
- **Production Environment**: Full backup and restore of `/var/www/orthodox-church-mgmt/orthodoxmetrics/prod`

## Security

- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid authentication
- **Role-based Access**: Only users with `super_admin` role can access
- **Middleware Protection**: Uses `authenticateToken` and `requireRole` middleware
- **Input Validation**: Validates environment and filename parameters
- **Directory Traversal Protection**: Prevents path manipulation attacks

## File Operations

### Backup Creation
- Uses `zip -r` command for efficient compression
- Excludes unnecessary files: `node_modules/*`, `.git/*`, `*.log`, `temp/*`, `uploads/temp/*`
- Creates timestamped files: `YYYY-MM-DD.zip`
- Prevents duplicate backups for the same day

### Backup Restoration
- Uses `extract-zip` for safe extraction
- Creates temporary directory for extraction
- Creates pre-restore backup before overwriting
- Uses `find` and `mv` commands for safe file movement
- Cleans up temporary files automatically

### File Management
- Validates filename format: `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\.zip$`
- Checks file existence before operations
- Provides detailed error messages
- Handles file permissions appropriately

## Setup Instructions

### Automatic Setup
Run the comprehensive setup script:
```bash
./setup-sdlc-backup-system.sh
```

### Manual Setup
1. **Create Backup Directories**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/backups/orthodoxmetrics/prod
   sudo mkdir -p /var/backups/orthodoxmetrics/dev
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/backups/orthodoxmetrics
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/backups/orthodoxmetrics
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install extract-zip archiver
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Restart Server** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure backup directories have proper ownership and permissions
2. **Disk Space**: Check available disk space before creating backups
3. **File Locking**: Ensure no processes are actively writing to files during backup
4. **Network Issues**: Large backups may timeout on slow connections

### Debug Commands

Check backup directories:
```bash
ls -la /var/backups/orthodoxmetrics/
ls -la /var/backups/orthodoxmetrics/prod/
ls -la /var/backups/orthodoxmetrics/dev/
```

Check disk space:
```bash
df -h /var/backups/orthodoxmetrics/
```

Test API endpoints:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/backups/list?env=prod
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/backups/create -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"env": "prod"}'
```

## Best Practices

### Backup Strategy
- **Daily Backups**: Create daily backups for critical environments
- **Retention Policy**: Implement a retention policy to manage disk space
- **Testing**: Regularly test restore operations in a safe environment
- **Monitoring**: Monitor backup sizes and creation times

### Security Considerations
- **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized users can access backup system
- **File Permissions**: Maintain appropriate file permissions on backup directories
- **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for all backup operations
- **Audit Logging**: Consider implementing audit logging for backup operations

### Performance Optimization
- **Exclusion Lists**: Exclude unnecessary files to reduce backup size
- **Compression**: Use efficient compression algorithms
- **Scheduling**: Schedule backups during low-usage periods
- **Storage**: Use fast storage for backup directories

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the SDLC Backup System:

1. **Automated Scheduling**: Cron-based automatic backup creation
2. **Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old backups
3. **Backup Verification**: Checksum verification of backup integrity
4. **Incremental Backups**: Support for incremental backup strategies
5. **Cloud Storage**: Integration with cloud storage providers
6. **Backup Encryption**: Optional encryption of backup files
7. **Performance Metrics**: Track backup creation times and sizes
8. **Email Notifications**: Notify administrators of backup status
