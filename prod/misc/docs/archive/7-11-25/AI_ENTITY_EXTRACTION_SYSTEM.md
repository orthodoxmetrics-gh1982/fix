# AI-Powered Entity Extraction System for Orthodox Church Records

## ü§ñ Overview

The AI-Powered Entity Extraction System is an advanced post-processing enhancement that builds upon the existing OCR pipeline to automatically extract structured data from Orthodox church records. This system uses pattern matching, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques to identify and extract key information from baptism certificates, marriage records, funeral documents, and other church records.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Field-Specific Patterns**: Specialized extraction for names, dates, places, clergy, family relationships, and religious information

### üìä Confidence Scoring
- **Field-Level Confidence**: Each extracted field receives a confidence score (0-100%)
- **Overall Extraction Confidence**: Aggregated confidence for the entire record
- **Automatic Review Flagging**: Low-confidence extractions are flagged for human review
- **Context-Aware Scoring**: Confidence based on pattern strength, field length, and contextual clues

### üéì Machine Learning & Improvement
- **User Correction Learning**: System learns from user corrections to improve future extractions
- **Pattern Evolution**: Extraction patterns improve based on feedback
- **Correction Logging**: All user corrections are logged for analysis and training

## üéØ Confidence Scoring System

### Confidence Levels
- **High (80-100%)**: Reliable extraction, minimal review needed
- **Medium (60-79%)**: Good extraction, light review recommended
- **Low (0-59%)**: Requires human review and correction

### Scoring Factors
1. **Pattern Strength**: How well the text matches extraction patterns
2. **Context Clues**: Surrounding text provides validation
3. **Field Length**: Longer matches generally more reliable
4. **Multiple Matches**: Consistent information across document
5. **Knowledge Base**: Matches known Orthodox terminology

### Automatic Review Flagging
- Records with overall confidence < 60% are flagged for review
- Individual fields with confidence < 40% are highlighted
- Missing critical fields trigger review requirements
- Inconsistent information patterns flag for attention
