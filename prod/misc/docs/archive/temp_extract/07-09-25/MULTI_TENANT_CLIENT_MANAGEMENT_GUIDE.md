3. **DNS Configuration**: Set up subdomains for client sites (optional)
4. **SSL Certificates**: Configure SSL for client domains
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure monitoring for new client sites

### Backup Strategy
- **Individual Backups**: Each client database backed up separately
- **Automated Backups**: Scheduled backups for all client data
