# Login Error Handling Test Guide

This document describes how to test the new user-friendly error handling in the login system.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced apiClient** (`/api/utils/axiosInstance.ts`)
   - Preserves HTTP status codes and error types
   - Prevents infinite redirect loops on 401 errors
   - Attaches error metadata for better classification

2. **Improved AuthService** (`/services/authService.ts`)
   - Converts technical errors to user-friendly messages
   - Handles different error scenarios appropriately
   - Provides detailed logging for debugging

3. **Enhanced Login UI** (`/views/authentication/authForms/AuthLogin.tsx`)
   - Shows contextual help based on error type
   - Provides relevant action links (password reset, support)
   - Uses Material-UI Alert with proper icon

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### 1. Network/Server Down Errors
**How to test:** Stop the backend server or disconnect from network
**Expected message:** "We're having trouble connecting to the server. Please try again later."
**UI features:** Shows support contact link and refresh suggestion

### 2. Invalid Credentials (401)
**How to test:** Enter wrong email/password
**Expected message:** "Incorrect email or password."
**UI features:** Shows "Reset it here" link to forgot password page

### 3. Server Errors (502/503/504)
**How to test:** 
- Set up nginx to return 502
- Or modify backend to return 503
**Expected message:** "The system is temporarily unavailable. Please try again shortly."
**UI features:** Shows system status page link

### 4. Rate Limiting (429)
**How to test:** Make multiple rapid login attempts
**Expected message:** "Too many login attempts. Please wait a moment and try again."

### 5. Custom Backend Messages
**How to test:** Backend returns user-friendly error message
**Expected behavior:** Shows the backend message if it's user-friendly

| 429 Rate limiting | "Too many login attempts. Please wait a moment and try again." |
| Unknown error | "Something went wrong. Please try again." |

## üîç Technical Details

### Error Object Structure
```javascript
{
  status: number | undefined,        // HTTP status code
  code: string | undefined,          // Error code (e.g., 'NETWORK_ERROR')
  isNetworkError: boolean,          // True if no response received
  message: string,                  // Original error message
  originalError: AxiosError         // Full axios error object
}
```

### Debugging
- Technical error details are logged to console for debugging
- User sees only friendly messages
- Original error information preserved for troubleshooting

2. **Reduced Support:** Clear guidance reduces support tickets
3. **Professional:** No more technical "status code 502" messages
4. **Actionable:** Contextual links help users resolve issues
5. **Debuggable:** Technical details still available in console
