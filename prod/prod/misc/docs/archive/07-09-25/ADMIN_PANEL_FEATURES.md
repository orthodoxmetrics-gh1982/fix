## Current Issues & Status

### Authentication Problems
**Status**: üî¥ Critical Issue
**Description**: Session authentication not working properly
**Impact**: Users getting 401 errors on admin features
**Workaround**: Temporary authentication bypass active

### Session Management
**Status**: üî¥ Under Investigation  
**Description**: Session user data not persisting across requests
**Symptoms**: Session ID exists but user data is undefined
**Root Cause**: Unknown - investigating nginx proxy and session store

### Admin Feature Access
**Status**: üü° Partially Working
**Description**: Some admin features work, others fail
**Working**: User Management, Logs
**Not Working**: Password Change, Churches (inconsistent)

## Security Considerations

### Role-Based Access Control
- Strict role verification on all admin endpoints
- Super admin restrictions prevent privilege escalation
- Session-based authentication with proper expiration

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data (passwords) never logged
- User data access controlled by roles
- Audit trail for admin actions

### Session Security
- HTTPOnly cookies prevent XSS
- Secure session storage in MySQL
- Rolling session expiration on activity

## Planned Improvements

### Short Term
1. Fix session authentication issues
2. Remove temporary authentication bypasses
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add comprehensive logging

### Medium Term
1. Implement email notifications for user creation
2. Add password history tracking
3. Enhance admin audit trail
4. Improve error messages and validation

### Long Term
1. Two-factor authentication for admin accounts
2. Advanced role management system
3. Bulk user operations
4. Admin dashboard with analytics
5. API rate limiting and security hardening

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to admin panel
3. Test each feature systematically
4. Verify role-based restrictions
5. Check error handling

### Automated Testing (Planned)
- Unit tests for admin functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints  
- Security tests for authorization
- Performance tests for large data sets

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **401 Errors**: Check session authentication
- **403 Errors**: Verify user role permissions
- **500 Errors**: Check backend logs and database connectivity

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify network requests in dev tools
3. Check backend logs for authentication issues
4. Verify database connectivity and session storage

### Log Locations
- Backend: `z:\server\logs\`
- Nginx: `/var/log/nginx/`
- Database: MySQL error logs
