# Orthodox Metrics Logs Panel - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Logs panel has been fully implemented with real-time logging capabilities, component-specific log management, and comprehensive log level controls.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Real-time Site Logs Tab
- **Live log streaming** using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Auto-refresh** every 2 seconds with fallback to polling
- **Auto-scroll** to newest logs
- **Filtering** by log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
- **Filtering** by component (Authentication, Database, API Server, etc.)
- **Search functionality** across log messages and components
- **Export logs** to JSON format
- **Clear logs** functionality

### 2. Component-Specific Logs Tab
- **Dropdown selection** for individual components
- **Dedicated log view** for each component
- **Same filtering and search** capabilities as site logs
- **Component descriptions** and metadata

### 3. Log Levels Management Tab
- **Set log levels** for each component individually
- **Enable/disable logging** per component
- **Real-time updates** to backend configuration
- **Visual indicators** for current log levels
- **Accordion-style interface** for easy management

### 4. Backend Integration
- **Winston logging** with multiple transports
- **Component-specific loggers** for each service
- **RESTful API endpoints** for log management
- **Server-Sent Events** for real-time streaming
- **Log level persistence** and configuration
- **Automatic request logging** middleware

## API Endpoints

### Log Management
- `GET /api/logs` - Get recent logs with filtering
- `GET /api/logs/stream` - Real-time log streaming (SSE)
- `GET /api/logs/components` - Get component log levels
- `PUT /api/logs/components/:component/level` - Update component log level
- `PUT /api/logs/components/:component/toggle` - Toggle component logging
- `GET /api/logs/component/:component` - Get logs for specific component
- `DELETE /api/logs` - Clear all logs
- `POST /api/logs/test` - Generate test logs

### Log Levels
- `debug` - All messages including debug info
- `info` - General information messages
- `warn` - Warning messages for potential issues
- `error` - Error messages only
- `fatal` - Critical errors only

## Components Monitored
1. **Authentication** - User login, logout, session management
2. **Database** - Database queries, connections, transactions
3. **API Server** - HTTP requests, responses, middleware
4. **Email Service** - Email sending, notifications
5. **File Upload** - File uploads, processing
6. **OCR Service** - OCR processing, document analysis

## How to Test

### 1. Access the Logs Panel
- Navigate to `/apps/logs` in your browser
- The panel should load with three tabs: Site Logs, Component Logs, Log Levels

### 2. Test Real-time Logging
1. **Generate Test Logs**:
   - Click the "Test Logs" button to generate sample logs
   - Watch logs appear in real-time in the Site Logs tab

2. **Make API Requests**:
   - Navigate to other parts of the application
   - Upload files, manage invoices, etc.
   - Watch request/response logs appear automatically

### 3. Test Filtering
1. **Filter by Log Level**:
   - Select different log levels from the dropdown
   - Watch logs filter in real-time

2. **Filter by Component**:
   - Select specific components from the dropdown
   - See only logs from that component

3. **Search Logs**:
   - Type in the search box
   - Watch logs filter based on your search term

### 4. Test Component-Specific Logs
1. Switch to the "Component Logs" tab
2. Select a component from the dropdown
3. View logs specific to that component

### 5. Test Log Level Management
1. Switch to the "Log Levels" tab
2. Expand any component accordion
3. Change the log level and watch the update
4. Toggle logging on/off for components

### 6. Test Export/Clear
1. Click "Export" to download logs as JSON
2. Click "Clear" to remove all logs
3. Click "Refresh" to reload logs

## File Structure
```
z:\server\
├── routes\logs.js           # Log API endpoints
├── middleware\logger.js     # Logging middleware
└── logs\                    # Log files directory
    ├── combined.log
    ├── error.log
    ├── auth.log
    ├── database.log
    ├── api.log
    ├── email.log
    ├── upload.log
    └── ocr.log

z:\front-end\src\views\apps\logs\
└── Logs.tsx               # Main logs component
```

## Technical Details

### Real-time Streaming
- Uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for efficient real-time updates
- Automatic fallback to polling if SSE is not supported
- Configurable refresh intervals

### Log Storage
- **In-memory storage** for recent logs (last 1000 entries)
- **File-based storage** using Winston transports
- **Component-specific log files** for better organization

### Performance
- **Efficient filtering** on both client and server side
- **Pagination support** for large log sets
- **Automatic log rotation** to prevent disk space issues

## Troubleshooting

### If logs aren't appearing:
1. Check if the server is running on port 3001
2. Verify the logs directory exists: `z:\server\logs\`
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Try generating test logs using the "Test Logs" button

### If real-time streaming isn't working:
1. Check if EventSource is supported in your browser
2. The system will automatically fallback to polling
3. Check network tab for SSE connection

### If log levels aren't updating:
1. Verify the backend API endpoints are responding
2. Check server logs for any errors
3. Try refreshing the page and reconfiguring

## Next Steps

The Logs panel is now fully functional and ready for production use. You can:

1. **Integrate with existing services** by importing the logging middleware
2. **Add more components** by updating the components array
3. **Customize log formats** by modifying the Winston configuration
4. **Add alerts** for critical errors or specific log patterns
5. **Implement log archiving** for long-term storage

The system is designed to be extensible and can easily accommodate additional logging requirements as your application grows.
