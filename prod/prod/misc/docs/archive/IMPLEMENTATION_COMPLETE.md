## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Run Individual Step Demos
```bash
# Run any specific step demonstration
node step1-demo.js    # Autonomous data acquisition
node step2-demo.js    # Enhanced data points
node step3-demo.js    # Intelligent validation
node step4-demo.js    # Data storage management
node step5-demo.js    # Frontend visualization
node step6-demo.js    # Full monitoring (requires DB)
```

### Option 2: Run Standalone Step 6 Demo
```bash
# No database required - demonstrates all Step 6 features
node server/step6-standalone-demo.js
```

### Option 3: Database Setup & Full System
```bash
# 1. Check database connection
node server/check-database-connection.js

# 2. Follow setup guide
# Read: server/DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md

# 3. Run full monitoring system
node step6-demo.js
```
