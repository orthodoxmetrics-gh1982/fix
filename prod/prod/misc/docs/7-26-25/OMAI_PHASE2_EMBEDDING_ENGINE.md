# OM-AI Phase 2: Embedding Engine + Context Memory

## üéØ Overview

Phase 2 of the OM-AI system transforms it from simple "responding" to actually "thinking" based on the site's knowledge. The system now includes:

- **Enhanced Vector Database**: Improved similarity calculations with multiple metrics
- **Structured Memory System**: Persistent storage of rules, components, and architecture
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Combines vector search with memory retrieval
- **Enhanced UI**: Multiple query modes and source transparency

## üîß Core Components

### 1. Memory System (`memory/`)

**Purpose**: Stores structured knowledge about the project

**Key Features**:
- **Rules**: Project-wide guidelines and constraints
- **Components**: Descriptions of key React components
- **Architecture**: System structure and database relationships
- **File Patterns**: Supported file types and directories
- **Directories**: Important project paths

**Example Memory Entry**:
```json
{
  "rules": [
    "Do not use Unstable_Grid2 due to known layout and style conflicts.",
    "All record tables must have a church_id foreign key."
  ],
  "components": {
    "LoginPage.tsx": "Handles user session with JWT + cookie-based auth.",
    "OMBigBook.tsx": "File management system for OrthodoxMetrics documentation."
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Vector Store (`embeddings/context-loader.ts`)

**Purpose**: Improved similarity search with multiple metrics

**Features**:
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Word overlap calculation
- **Cosine Similarity**: Vector-based similarity
- **Exact Match Bonus**: Phrase matching rewards
- **Weighted Combination**: Balanced scoring system

**Similarity Calculation**:
```typescript
const weightedSimilarity = (jaccardSimilarity * 0.4) + 
                          (cosineSimilarity * 0.4) + 
                          (exactMatchBonus * 0.2);
```

### 3. Context Integration (`index.ts`)

**Purpose**: Combines vector search with memory retrieval

**Process**:
1. **Vector Search**: Find relevant files from embeddings
2. **Memory Search**: Retrieve relevant rules and components
3. **Context Combination**: Merge both sources
4. **Response Generation**: Use combined context for LLM

## üìä Sample Use Cases

### 1. Authentication Query
**User Input**: "How is user authentication handled?"

**System Response**:
```
Authentication is handled in LoginPage.tsx via /api/auth/login. 
It uses JWT stored in cookies, validated by auth.middleware.ts. 
The user object is persisted via session.store.ts.

--- Sources ---
front-end/src/pages/Login.tsx
server/middleware/auth.js
server/routes/auth.js

--- Memory Context ---
Component LoginPage.tsx: Handles user session with JWT + cookie-based auth.
Rule: User accounts should be stored in orthodoxmetrics_db; the church database is only for record holding.
```

### 2. Component Analysis
**User Input**: "Explain the OMBigBook component"

**System Response**:
```
OMBigBook.tsx is a file management system for OrthodoxMetrics documentation and code files. 
It provides a comprehensive interface for browsing, searching, and managing project files.

--- Sources ---
front-end/src/components/admin/OMBigBook.tsx
docs/OM-BigBook/README.md

--- Memory Context ---
Component OMBigBook.tsx: File management system for OrthodoxMetrics documentation and code files.
Rule: Do not use Unstable_Grid2 due to known layout and style conflicts.
```

### Memory Integration
- **Rule Matching**: Automatically applies relevant project rules
- **Component Recognition**: Identifies and explains components
- **Architecture Awareness**: Understands system structure

### Context Quality
