# Task #014 – Refactor Records Management Page Using Shop Layout

## 🌟 Objective

Refactor the existing **Records Management** page to utilize the layout and interactive UI from the **E-commerce Shop** page.

---

## 📌 Overview

Replace the current records management interface with the modular, card-based layout used at:

```
https://orthodoxmetrics.com/apps/ecommerce/shop
```

This update will improve user experience, navigation, and consistency across the platform.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Layout & Styling ✅

* ✅ Replicated the **Shop** page structure
* ✅ Card grid layout for record types
* ✅ Reused `ShopGrid.tsx` and `ProductCard.tsx` patterns → `RecordList.tsx` and `RecordCard.tsx`
* ✅ Applied OrthodoxMetrics brand styling

### 2. Record Categories ✅

Each card represents a record category:

* ✉️ **Baptism Records** - 👶 Sacramental
* 🛍️ **Marriage Records** - 💒 Sacramental  
* ⚰️ **Funeral Records** - ⚱️ Sacramental
* ⛪ **Clergy Records** - Administrative
* 💰 **Donations** - Administrative
* 📅 **Calendar Events** - Administrative
* 👥 **Church Members** - Membership

Card includes:
* ✅ Icon or visual for record type
* ✅ Count of records (from backend API)
* ✅ Buttons: **View**, **Add**, **Export**, **Preview**
* ✅ Category color coding
* ✅ Last updated timestamp
* ✅ More actions menu

### 3. Routing Changes ✅

* ✅ Main records page: `src/pages/apps/records/index.tsx`
* ✅ Individual record type pages:
  * `/apps/records/baptism`
  * `/apps/records/marriage`
  * `/apps/records/funeral`
* ✅ Menu integration with legacy fallback

### 4. Component Breakdown ✅

* ✅ `RecordCard.tsx`: modified `ProductCard` for records
* ✅ `RecordList.tsx`: reused from `ShopGrid.tsx` pattern
* ✅ `RecordSearch.tsx`: search functionality
* ✅ `RecordSidebar.tsx`: filter sidebar
* ✅ `RecordFilter.tsx`: comprehensive filtering
* ✅ `recordRoutes.ts`: routing integration
* ✅ Uses Material-UI, theme support, and dynamic props

### 5. Advanced Sidebar Filtering ✅

* ✅ Filtering options by category, date, search term
* ✅ Search bar for record type lookup  
* ✅ Sort by name, count, last updated
* ✅ Quick filter presets
* ✅ Active filter chips with removal
* ✅ Church selection for super admins

### 6. OMAI Context Integration ✅

* ✅ When OMAI is present:
  * Context: `/apps/records`
  * Offer suggestions, previews, or shortcut actions
  * Voice command integration ready
