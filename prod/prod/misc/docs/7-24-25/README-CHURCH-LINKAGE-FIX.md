## 📁 **Files Created**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `server/database/fix-church-linkage.sql` | ⚡ **Main migration script** - Fixes all linkage issues |
| `server/database/fixed-church-database-template.sql` | 🏗️ **Corrected template** - For future church databases |
| `server/database/diagnosis-report.md` | 📋 **Detailed analysis** - Full technical documentation |

## 🚀 **Quick Start (5 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Run Audit (Safe - No Changes)**
```bash
# Linux/macOS:
cd server/scripts
./run-church-linkage-fix.sh

# Windows:
cd server/scripts
bash run-church-linkage-fix.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Create backups of your databases
- ✅ Audit your church databases for issues
- ✅ Show you exactly what needs to be fixed
- ❌ **Make NO changes** (dry run mode)

### **Step 2: Review Audit Results**
Check the generated `backups/church-linkage-fix-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/audit_results.txt` file to see:
- Which tables are missing `church_id` columns
- Which records need to be backfilled
- Which foreign keys need to be fixed

### **Step 3: Run Migration (When Ready)**
```bash
# LIVE MIGRATION - Will modify databases!
./run-church-linkage-fix.sh --live
```

This will:
- ✅ Fix all `church_id` relationships
- ✅ Remove local `church_info` tables
- ✅ Add proper indexes
- ✅ Validate the results

## 🎯 **What This Fixes**

### **Before (Broken):**
```
❌ ssppoc_records_db.baptism_records.church_id → local church_info.id (WRONG!)
❌ Local church_info tables (violates multi-tenant architecture)
❌ Inconsistent foreign key targets
❌ Missing church_id columns in some tables
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
✅ ssppoc_records_db.baptism_records.church_id → orthodoxmetrics_db.churches.id
✅ All church metadata in global orthodoxmetrics_db.churches table
✅ Consistent church_id references across all databases
✅ Proper multi-tenant data segregation
```

## 📊 **Expected Impact**

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Admin Dashboards** | ❌ Can't join church metadata with records | ✅ Perfect church-specific reporting |
| **Data Segregation** | ❌ Broken multi-tenant boundaries | ✅ Proper church isolation |
| **OCR Record Tagging** | ❌ Can't assign records to correct church | ✅ Automatic church assignment |
| **Billing Integration** | ❌ Can't generate church-specific invoices | ✅ Accurate billing per church |
| **User Permissions** | ❌ Inconsistent church-based access | ✅ Proper role-based access control |

## ⚠️ **Safety Features**

- 🔒 **Automatic Backups**: All databases backed up before changes
- 🧪 **Dry Run Default**: Audit mode by default, requires `--live` flag for changes
- 🔍 **Validation**: Comprehensive checks before and after migration
- 🔄 **Rollback Ready**: Backups can restore original state if needed
- 📝 **Detailed Logging**: Complete audit trail of all changes

## 🔧 **Manual Execution (Alternative)**

If you prefer to run the SQL directly:

1. **Backup your databases first!**
2. Run the audit SQL script: `server/database/fix-church-linkage.sql`
3. Review the audit results
4. Uncomment the migration calls for your specific databases
5. Re-run the script to execute the migration

## 📞 **Need Help?**

1. **Review the diagnosis**: `server/database/diagnosis-report.md`
2. **Check audit results**: Generated in `backups/` directory
3. **Test on staging first**: Always recommended for production systems

---

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

After running the migration, you should see:

- ✅ All church record tables have `church_id` columns
- ✅ All `church_id` values reference valid `orthodoxmetrics_db.churches.id`
- ✅ No local `church_info` tables in church databases
- ✅ Admin dashboards can join church data with records
- ✅ Multi-tenant queries work correctly
