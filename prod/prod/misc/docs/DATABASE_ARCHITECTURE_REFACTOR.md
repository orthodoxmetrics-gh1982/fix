# Database Architecture Refactor Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. Database Service Layer
- Created `services/databaseService.js` with proper database routing
- Added helper functions for church record database access
- Implemented `getChurchRecordDatabase()` and `getChurchMetadata()`

### 2. Database Router Middleware
- Created `middleware/databaseRouter.js` for automatic request routing
- Integrated into `index.js` after session middleware

### 3. Updated Routes
- `routes/churches.js` - Now uses `orthodoxmetrics_db.churches` for all church metadata
- `routes/admin.js` - Already properly using platform database
- `routes/clientApi.js` - Updated to get church info from platform database
- `routes/clients.js` - Updated to get church metadata from platform database
- `routes/importRecords.js` - Fixed church validation to use platform database
- `routes/churchSetupWizard.js` - Updated to get church info from platform database

## ✅ ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE

### Platform Database (`orthodoxmetrics_db`)
- ✅ Users, roles, permissions
- ✅ Church metadata (name, address, email, settings)
- ✅ OCR configurations and audit logs
- ✅ Login/session data
- ✅ Language preferences
- ✅ System settings

### Church Record Databases (e.g., `ssppoc_records_db`)
- ✅ baptism_records
- ✅ marriage_records  
- ✅ funeral_records
- ✅ record_history
- ❌ NO church metadata
- ❌ NO user data
- ❌ NO login info

### Record Access Pattern
- Use `churches.database_name` to determine correct record DB
- Query platform DB for church metadata
- Query record DB only for actual records

## 🎯 RESULT
- Clean separation of platform vs record data
- All church management uses `orthodoxmetrics_db`
- Records access properly routed to church-specific databases
- Frontend church management now works correctly with proper data source
